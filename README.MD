# Description

#### This is a platform where gaming enthusiasts can share their expertise and strategies for any game. Users have the ability to create posts, comment on them, and manage their content using the Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) operations.

#### To ensure the quality of content, posts created by normal users will be placed in a pending list and require approval from the Admin before they are made public. This process helps maintain the integrity of the platform and ensures that only valuable and relevant information is shared with the community.

#### We strive to make your experience on our platform as enjoyable as possible. Join us today and unlock a world of gaming tips and tricks!
